                        Tendo is a soft robotic exoskeleton.
                        Imagine a robotic glove, which strengthens your grip. 
                        It covers the thumb, index finger and forearm and itâ€™s 
                        equipped with soft artificial tendons and smart sensors 
                        detecting when you are about to grasp an object and applies 
                        the requested strength to your fingers. That way it gets easier
                        and easier to use it.
                    </p>
                </div>

                        Tendo creates greater independence for people suffering 
                        from limitations due to e.g. arthritis, an injury, 
                        stroke or age and results in an improved self-image and 
                        quality of life as well as a reduced need of assistance 
                        from the community and family. Tendo is worn almost like 
                        a glove and enables a strong grip in more or less all everyday situations.
